# Rsearch and Reflection Journal
Research and Reflection Journal for DGL 104 course

WEEK 8

This week felt like a big shift in the course. So far, we’ve mostly been learning the basics of good coding — like writing clear documentation, fixing bugs, testing, and reviewing code — through activities like the MIT App Inventor assignment and the Programming Practice Article. Now, we’re stepping into real development, where we’ll start building with a specific programming language and focus on things like design patterns, app structure, and writing actual user requirements.

I also got started with my Research and Reflection Journal! I accepted the GitHub Classroom invite and created my own journal repo where I’ll be tracking all my weekly progress and reflections from now until the end of the semester.

## Language Research: Lua
For our language research activity, I picked Lua — I had heard of it before but never really looked into it. 

It turns out Lua is a small and fast scripting language that’s used a lot in video games (like Roblox and World of Warcraft) and embedded systems.

Who uses it? Game developers, hardware engineers, and software teams working with embedded tech.

Why it’s useful: Lua is great for extending programs or customizing apps without making them heavy or slow.

Some helpful resources I found:

Lua.org – the official documentation, straight from the creators.

Learn Lua in Y Minutes – a nice quick overview for fast learners.

GitHub repositories – good to see how real people use Lua in actual projects.

Writing User Stories (Using Instagram)

For the user story activity, I picked Instagram since I use it almost daily and understand the features well.

## Here’s a general story:

As a user, I can post a photo to share with my followers.
More detailed ones:

As a user, I can add filters before sharing.

As a user, I can tag friends in the photo.

As a user, I can write captions and add hashtags.

As a user, I can schedule my post for later.

Acceptance criteria for tagging friends:

There’s a “Tag People” option before posting.

I can search usernames and tag them easily.

Tagged users show up as clickable names on the post.

The tagged person gets a notification.

Doing this helped me think like a developer. It’s not just about what the feature is, but also how it should behave and how the user will interact with it.
